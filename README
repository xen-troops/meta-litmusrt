Yocto layer for LITMUS-RT system
=============================================

This layer allows building LITMUS-RT system using Yocto.


Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
  branch: pyro


Minimal LITMUS-RT image
=======================

The meta-litmusrt provides minimal LITMUS-RT image:
	* litmusrt-image-minimal

This is the minimal initramfs image together with LITMUS-RT specific kernel
together with functional liblitmus and feather-trace-tools.
This image was intentinally created to provide synthetic RT load for virtualized
environment (XEN) and measure its reliability, so has correspondent specifics.
E.g. FeatherTrace functionality required Python is not available on the system 
itself, but you can grab collected data to the host using ssh for extended
post-processing.
Currently tested for aarch64 only.

Patches
=======
Please submit any patches against the meta-litmusrt layer as PR to:

Adding the litmusrt layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the litmusrt layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the litmusrt layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-litmusrt \
    "

Build a minimal LITMUS-RT system for ARMv8
==========================================

    git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky -b pyro
    git clone https://github.com/xen-troops/meta-litmusrt
    . poky/oe-init-build-env
    bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-litmusrt
    MACHINE=genericarmv8 bitbake litmusrt-image-minimal

Wait a bit.
Enjoy of images found in tmp/deploy/images/genericarmv8/ .
